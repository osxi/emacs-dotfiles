My init.el

### Background

This is how I'm using Emacs right now for programming and general text manipulation.

### Installation

  - Install `mu4e` and `mu` at the operating system level
  - Make sure you're on >= 25.1
  - Clone down osxi/powerline to lisp/
  - Clone down chumpage/chumpy-windows to lisp/
  - Comment out config that breaks due to missing packages
  - Run `package-install-selected-packages` until everything in `package-selected-packages` is installed
